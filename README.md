# Museum-Art-Dialogue
## Museum Art Dialogue, is a microblogging platform for art professionals, art enthusiasts, and general public to share their experiences and ideas about artwork in museums. Through this platform, we aim to create space for underrepresented voices, bridge the knowledge gap between art professionals and the public, and generate meaningful conversations about art.
